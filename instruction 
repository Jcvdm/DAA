They wil receive a ref number - they wil use that ref to login, they will be welcomed to a page that greet them and explains this is a digital asseasment guide, they can follow the steps and this will guide them. So when the say next or continue, it should be a step guide I think 1. They should confirm their details(obviously the insurance would already have provided the details  so they should be able to edit info - lets make it intuitive) the rhey should confirm info -next shouls be the same but dor their vehicle info make model color etc, then next step is in incidnet details, description and scene photos if poasible, then a document upload step if they have any docuemnts to upload quotes etc(optionl) then the next step will start the digital photo guide - here they should be guided trough the pr9cess of taking photos of their vehicle, it should go reg, front, right front, right side, right rear, rear, left rear, left side, left front, right front rim, right front tyre - same for other wheels with spare, photo of jack and tools if any, engine bay, intrior front, choose if vehicle auto or maunel, milage photo, interior rear, then incident photos close and further away, photos - this should be able tp be done by drag and drop on pc or a guided with mobile - create a extremenly detailed guide step by step, with requiremrnts possible errors, libraries, components etc what we need to use to achieve this, I wabt to use react and MUI For front end and then not sure what backed Im thinking supabase db for ease of use - you should think of eveything example front end compression to save data etc
